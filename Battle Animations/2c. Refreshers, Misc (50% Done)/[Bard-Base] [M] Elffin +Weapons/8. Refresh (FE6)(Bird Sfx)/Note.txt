Note: To port the sound effect, you have to import from Binding Blade:

It's base sound is placed at 1FA and 1FB, you can always decide to select another empty space to use the sound effect instead and edit those adresses in the animation.

In Binding Blade:
EE = Harp Sound
ED = Bird Tweet

In this animation
1FA = Harp Sound
1FB = Bird Tweet
