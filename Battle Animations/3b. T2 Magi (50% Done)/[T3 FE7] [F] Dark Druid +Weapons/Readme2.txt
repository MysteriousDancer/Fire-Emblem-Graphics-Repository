Hello there.

My name on feuniverse is CamusZekeSirius (it can be abbreviated to simply CZS 
if you wish), and this package was a project I initially picked up on from finding
the standing the standing frame of this animation from a man on serenesforest
with the name of Vampire Elf, and I had obtained permission to use and work on it.
After some time had passed, this project turned into a collaboration between me and
another feuniverse user named SHYUTERz. As such, me and SHYUTER are pretty much the
producers of this animation, so if there are any question that you would like to ask,
refer to us if you need, though the technical question should be directed to SHYUTER,
not me, as I am not as good as he is in terms of technical knowledge.

In this animation package, the following items are in this pack:

-Female Dark Druid without dark aura
 -The Female DD animation that lacks Nergal's dark aura.
-Female Dark Druid with dark aura
 -The Female DD animation that has Nergal's dark aura visual effect.
-Female Dark Druid Sorcerer style
 -This Female DD animation has a magic casting animation that more similar in style
  to the Sorcerer animation, even the critical part of the animation is different.
-Female Dark Druid Staff
 -This is the staff animation for the Female Dark Druid
-Female Dark Druid Class Card
 -The class card for this animation
-Female Dark Druid Map Sprites
 -The Map sprites for the Female Dark Druid, includes the idle and moving icons.
-必読(Must Read Me)!!
 -This is a read me that is created by SHYUTER, be sure to read this along with this
  read me.

I thank you for reading this. If you use this animation, please credit me and SHYUTER.

With best regards, CamusZekeSirius.
